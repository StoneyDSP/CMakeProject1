# What is it?
Generic CMake Project template for a full CI pipeline, with in-built package dependancy manager and html documetation generated by doxygen integration.

## Features;

- Flexible build targets driven by CMake and MSBuild
- Microsoft vcpkg toolchain for package dependency management
- Support for Git submodule import
- Doxygen html document generator
- Host a GitHub Page for your project documentation at the click of a button
- Full IntelliSense support for all modules

# How to use it?
Just <a href= "https://github.com/StoneyDSP/CMakeProject1.git">clone the repo</a>, generate the project build files, and run.

## Get vcpkg for dependency management;

Note; This is a global configuration step, and thus only needs to be performed once, and once only, on the entire operating system.

The following references the steps provider by in the official documentation at: https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html

Step 1: Clone (or Fork) the vcpkg repo

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git

Step 2: Run the bootstrap script to build vcpkg

    .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

Step 3: Run the vcpkg IDE Integration installer command

    .\vcpkg\vcpkg integrate install

Step 4: Create a new Environment variable called VCPKG_ROOT pointing to the root folder of your local vcpkg repo

    Windows:

    1. Hit "search" button in the Windows taskbar, and type "env...";

    2. Choose "Edit the system environment variables" from Control Panel;

    3. Click the "Environment Variables..." button;

    4. Under the "System Variables" entries, click "New...";

    5. For "Variable name", enter "VCPKG_ROOT" (all caps, no quotation marks!)

    6. For "Variable value", enter the absolute path to your local vcpkg repo's root folder, i.e., C:/path/to/vcpkg

    Example:

    Edit system variable

    Variable name: VCPKG_ROOT
    Variable value: C:/Code/vcpkg

    Click "ok" and restart your Powershell.

Once complete, vcpkg should now be cloned into your chosen directory, with an environment variable pointing to that directory. The "bootstrap" and "integrate" commands in steps 2 and 3 have set up the host machine for vcpkg dependency management. A couple of special files in our build take care of all the rest (keep reading for more).

You now have everything you need to begin your CMake project. You may go ahead and open the cloned repo's root folder (containing the upper-most "CMakeLists.txt" file) in your IDE of choice (i.e., Visual Studio 2022 or VSCode!), where the project will begin configuring several Cache files (and downloading/resolving package dependencies via vcpkg), generating the binary build files in the process.

*Tip: To see a full list of available packages in vcpkg with a short description and version number, run the following command from the PowerShell (where "\path\to\" should be your local directory):

    C:\path\to\vcpkg .\vcpkg search

*Tip: Although the build system will take of this automatically in project builds, it is possible to manually install a package locally for global reference.

To install a package, run the following command from the PowerShell (where "\path\to\" should be your local directory):

    C:\path\to\vcpkg .\vcpkg install <package_name>

e.g.,

    C:\path\to\vcpkg .\vcpkg install portaudio

You can also specify an architecture to use for the package, such as x86 or x64 (and others in some cases):

    C:\path\to\vcpkg .\vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows
